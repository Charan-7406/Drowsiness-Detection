# Drowsiness-Detection
The main objective is to first design a system to detect driverâ€™s drowsiness by continuously monitoring the drivers eyes. The system works in various lighting conditions and alert the driver on the detection of drowsiness by using buzzer or alarm. Also used a espeak which is software speech synthesizer in the program.

# System requirements
 A good CPU and a GPU with atleast 8GB memory.
 Atleast 8GB of RAM.
 Active internet connection to download the pretarined model.
 
 
# Note:
I have made a  yawn detection program which is not been mentioned in the documentation pdf,and integrated this yawn detection module with the drowsiness detection. The program is named as EAR and yawn detection.py .

#The pretrained model is availabe in the link below:
https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition

### Dependencies 
* numpy 
* opencv
* dlib 
* imutils
* tkinter(for the user interface)

# This reprository contains:
* A documentation pdf file.
* drowsiness_detection_EAR.py file which is the  python program for drowsiness detection using EAR algorithm.
* yawn_detect.py file which is the  python program for yawn detection.
* EAR_and_yawn_detect.py file which is the  python program for yawn detection and drowsiness detection.
* UI_using_tkinter.py file which is the  python program which is the  User interface for the above mentioned programs.
