# Drowsiness-Detection
The main objective is to first design a system to detect driverâ€™s drowsiness by continuously monitoring the drivers eyes. The system works in various lighting conditions and alert the driver on the detection of drowsiness by using buzzer or alarm.

# Note:
I have made a  yawn detection program which is not been mentioned in the documentation pdf,and also  combined it with the drowsiness detection using the ear algorithm program.

# the pretrained model is availabe in the link below:
